This project is more focused on designing a game engine, and there is also a sample game that unfortunately could not be completed due to issues with art.

This project can be run on windows simply by running the .bat file.

Controls:
"z" for interacting, "x" for cancelling
"WASD" for movement, Arrow keys for menu movement

Currently, there is only one NPC to talk to.

The game is called "Run Away", and your goal is very simple. You must survive.
Good luck!
